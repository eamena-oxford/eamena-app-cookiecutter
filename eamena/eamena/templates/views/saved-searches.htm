            <p>Clearance (bulldozing and levelling) is a common cause of disturbance of archaeological sites. It often takes place to prepare the ground for a variety of uses, including construction and infrastructure projects and agricultural fields and terracing, or the deliberate looting of archaeological sites. In recent decades, increasingly easy access to bulldozers has radically expanded the challenges that heritage protection organisations are facing.</p>

            <p>Agricultural and pastoral activities form another major cause of disturbance of archaeological heritage. Sites may be bulldozed to create agricultural fields/terraces or to make room for irrigation projects. Ploughing and the planting of orchards and palms seriously affect archaeological deposits buried close to the surface. Animals may trample across sites, destroying artefacts and structures; however, the presence of shepherds and their flocks can also protect sites against looters.</p>

            <p>Using satellite imagery and aerial photographs of different dates, it is possible to build a picture of the change in condition of archaeological sites across time. This search provides an overview of sites from the EAMENA database that are considered completely destroyed. As the database is still a work in progress, the search results do not paint an objective picture across the whole region, but reflect where the majority of our detailed assessments have taken place to date.</p>

            <p>The Neolithic and Natufian site of Beidha is part of the World Heritage Site of Petra. It was occupied over the course of the transition from hunting and gathering to early farming. The site is also important because of the transition from (sub-)circular to rectangular architecture.</p>

            <p>At the crossroads between Arabia, Egypt, and Phoenicia, the Nabataean caravan-city of Petra is famous for its rock-carved tombs. In addition, there are temples, religious high places, and an elaborate water system consisting of a large network of channels, dams, cisterns, and reservoirs</p>

            <p>Perhaps the best preserved fort of the so-called Limes Arabicus, Qasr Bshir (ancient Castra Pretorii Mobeni) is located in central Jordan. It is the only Roman fort anywhere with its dedicatory inscription still in place above the main gate and this records that it was built during the Roman Tetrarchic period (AD 293–305).</p>

            <p>Quoted several times in the Bible and especially famous for its conquest by Joshua (Joshua 6:26), Jericho/Tell al-Sultan has a long and almost continuous occupation from the Natufian period (10th millennium BC) to our day. The so-called "Tower of Jericho", dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (8000 BC) is regarded as the oldest stone structures ever discovered.</p>

            <p>The Khirbet Birzeit Research and Excavation project was carried out in the late 1990s by the Institute of Archaeology, Birzeit University. The ruins of a Mamluk building on the summit of a hill, interpreted as a local administrative centre, were excavated, revealing a continuous pottery sequence from the Iron Age to the Ottoman period.</p>

            <p>Mar Saba (St Sabbas) was a 5th/6th-century hermit living in a cave near the Dead Sea. He attracted many followers, resulting in the formation of the Great Laura (a grouping of hermit’s dwellings centred around a church). A community of monks still lives at Deir Mar Saba today. Many of the cave dwellings have surviving Byzantine and Crusader elements.</p>
